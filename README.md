# Module 2 Challenge
## Portfolio of Work

This project is an online portfolio designed to showcase the projects that I have completed all in one place and provide an easy way for others to see my work online.

It solves the problem  of having to provide multiple different links, or alternatively needing to send people a link directly to github to look at my projects. This is a much more user-friendly way of displaying my work neatly all in one place. It also allows me to showcase my web development skills with CSS and HTML in the portfolio website itself and allows me to create a good first impression for potential employers.


I learned some new skills such as more advanced manipulation of flexbox in CSS, including some basic hover animations and how to use CSS selectors to not only target divs, but also classes and ids. I also learnt how to use media queries to help ensure the site can be accessible for multiple devices including tablet and mobile as well as desktop.

I also learnt how to develop a website which is going to be accessible and usable for various different devices such as mobile, tablet and PC. This is an important skill as so many users are likely to visit websites using some form of mobile device or tablet and therefore it is of utmost importance to consider these users when creating a website.
